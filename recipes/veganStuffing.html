        <h3>Enjoy a guilt free thanksgiving staple all year long!</h3>
        <p>Introducing the first in a series of easy to prepare, nutritious and delicious PlantPowered recipes I will be publishing over the next several days. </p>
        <p>First up, gluten free vegan stuffing.  Who doesn't love stuffing?  And who said stuffing requires all that lard? This is a new recipe that I am very happy with.  The seaweed really went the extra mile to make this gluten free stuffing sing.  Everyone in my family was really pleased.  I hope you will be too!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 loafs gluten free bread, cubed</li>
            <li>4 celery stalks with leaves</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon macadamia nut oil or olive oil</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves peeled and finely chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 shallot finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cups of wild mushrooms washed, stems removed</li>
            <li>1/4 cup premium atlantic organic seaweed finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon thyme</li>
            <li>juice of 1/2 small lemon</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon gluten free tamari</li>
            <li>1 cup filtered water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Preparation:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the gluten free bread loafs into 1/2 inch cubes.  Spread them out evenly in a flat rectangular baking dish.  Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large sauce pan,  saut√© onion and garlic on a medium flame for 30 seconds, then add the chopped celery and stir until the color brightens. </li>
            <li>Add mushrooms and continue to saute until brown and the juices have made a nice broth in the pan.</li>  
            <li>Squeeze a half of a lemon and add the tamari and stir again. </li>
            <li>Turn sauteed mixture out over the bread cubes.  Sprinkle with the fresh herbs and mix well.  If needed add a teaspoon of large grain celtic sea salt.  I ended up not needing any extra salt.</li>
            <li> Transfer to a large flat casserole dish.  Add 1/2 cup of filtered water. </li>
            <li>Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 20 minutes at 350 degrees or until hot.</li>

           
        </ol>
