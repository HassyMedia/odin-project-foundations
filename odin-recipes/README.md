# odin-recipes
The following is HTML project of the foundation course for the Odin Project. My task is to design a basic HTML recipe website. The website will consist of an index page as well as links to several recipes. The goal of the project is to practice the basic html and git skills learnt in the HTML foundation course. Including how to write an html boilerplate, using tags to include elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images. I will be creating a git repository for the project, cloning it to my computer, and using the git commands learnt to manage the basic git workflow as well as adding commit messages to the best of my ability. In addition, I will do my best to make this basic website look as adequate as possible given the lack of CSS styling.
